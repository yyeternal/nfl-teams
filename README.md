# README for NFL Stadiums  #

This was a project that I made for my AP Computer Science Principles course. It uses applab and Javascript to make an application that displays information about different NFL Stadiums. 

It uses a database for NFL teams and has a home screen and an information screen, where the user is able to select the team they want, and the app displays fun facts about the team as well as the size of their stadium.
